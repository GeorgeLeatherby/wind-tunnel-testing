"""
Wake-center deflection and wake-survey point distribution for Task 2.

Physical picture (Lecture 3, "Wake Deflection by Yaw Misalignment", and the
Cacciola/Bottasso paper on wake-center tracking): when the turbine is yawed, the
wake is deflected laterally. To place the wake-probe points usefully we must
distribute them *around the expected wake center*, which shifts in the Y
(lateral) direction depending on the yaw angle and the downstream distance.

We use the classical Jimenez (2010) analytical wake-deflection model to predict
the lateral position of the wake center, and then build a hub-height line of Y
positions that is denser near that center and sparser towards the edges (the
paper shows the wake center is best resolved when points straddle it).

Reference frame (assignment): X is the downwind direction, Z points downwards,
origin at the hub center. Y is the remaining (lateral) horizontal axis. Wake
measurements are limited to hub height, i.e. Z = 0.

Each formula is its own function.
